<h2 id="about-beat-hive">About Beat Hive</h2>

<p>The Beat Hive metronome serves as a musician’s practice tool with <em>lots</em> of functionality! While its basic purpose is to keep the beat, it also has multiple sounds which can be used, and a whole library of beats which the user can save, edit and reload for use. Beyond that it has all of the normal functionality a normal metronome does.</p>

<p>The Beat Hive serves as a normal metronome and can keep time from 60 beats per minute all the way to 200 beats per minute. It can be stopped and started with just one touch, and can make use of subdivisions like any other advanced metronome. If all you’re looking is to keep time, the Beat Hive can definitely do that and with ease!</p>

<p>The sound package of the metronome also includes four differing sounds that allow the user to both create beats that are interesting and could accompany the player as well as be used to differentiate different subdivisions, beats, or even measures. The four sounds include a clave, hi-hat, snare drum, and bass drum. These four sounds together give the user flexibility in how their metronome sounds, and each sound is just a touch away.</p>

<p>The editing functionality of Beat Hive is what allows the user to save time when reusing beats or saving ideas for later. The user can add subdivisions and change the sounds of all available subdivisions to any sound listed above. This allows for the creation of complex patterns that can be used to challenge the user as well as accompany them. Since even whole measures can be added a musician could do an on/off drill where the metronome kept time for one measure and then remained silent for another, all the while testing that the musician can keep time during the silence, with a way to check themselves not far off. Because of the drum-like sounds of the metronome, simple drum beats can be input to accompany the player and give them a more relaxed and enjoyable practice session.</p>

<p>The final function of the Beat Hive is persistence. Like a vast honeycomb the Beat Hive stores all of your sweet, phat beats so that you can return to them at any time. Beats can be created, deleted, and are custom named. Not happy with a beat? Go ahead and edit it and change it to be just what you want and keep updating it as you go. The user is in control of their beats and will have all the benefits the save, edit, and load features offer.</p>

<p>Overall the metronome can serve as a practice tool or a practice toy, but either way it is used it will be sure to make the musician’s practice session more fun, productive, and timely!</p>
